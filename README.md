Abstract—Chronic liver disease (CLD) stands as a formidable
health challenge, casting a long shadow across global healthcare
landscapes. Its progression, often silent until advanced stages,
makes it a particularly perilous condition, leading to significant
morbidity and mortality if left unchecked. The dangers of liver
disease cannot be overstated, with its ability to disrupt the liver’s
essential functions, from filtering toxins to aiding in digestion.
Awareness about liver health is crucial, as early detection can
dramatically alter the course of the disease, offering pathways
to management or even reversal of damage in some cases. In the
United States, liver disease has become a significant health crisis,
with alarming statistics highlighting the need for urgent attention.
Liver disease accounts for thousands of deaths annually, with
recent figures indicating a steady rise in liver-related mortality.
Factors contributing to this trend include the prevalence of
hepatitis C, alcohol-related liver disease, and the emerging
epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), driven by
rising obesity rates. These statistics serve not just as numbers
but as a clarion call for enhanced prevention, early detection,
and treatment efforts to stem the tide of CLD. Advancements
in machine learning (ML) models offer a beacon of hope in
the fight against liver disease. Researchers can now predict the
onset and progression of liver disease more accurately than
ever by employing models such as RandomForest, LightGBM,
XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Ensemble Learning Stacking, and
ExtraTrees. These models, through their predictive capabilities,
have the potential to revolutionize how we approach CLD,
making it possible to identify at-risk individuals earlier and tailor
interventions more effectively. The impact of these technological
innovations could be profound, significantly reducing mortality
rates by enabling the medical community to act swiftly and
decisively in preventing and managing liver disease.
